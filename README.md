# hookie
A simple Ruby script to demo using GitHub's [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) and [Status API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/). 

You'll need to create an [Access Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) and store it in an environment variable called `GH_AUTH_TOKEN` for this to work
